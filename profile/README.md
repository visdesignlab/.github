# The Visualization Design Lab (VDL) at the University of Utah 

This is the main organization for code developed at VDL. Feel free to browse, clone, and contribute! 

We also maintain a few larger projects that are hosted in different organizations. These are: 

* [The reVISit project](https://github.com/reVISit-studies/) — A user-study framework based on a declarative grammar for study specification. 
* [The trrack project](https://github.com/trrack) — Provenance tracking (history, undo/redo, etc.) and visualziation for web-based applications.
* [The MultiNet project](https://github.com/multinet-app) – Multivariate network visualization.
